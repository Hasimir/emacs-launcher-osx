============
Stuff to Add
============

* Explain difference between this thing and exec-path-from-shell.el (see https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell for details).
* Describe shell script as .app structure, include acknowledgement of Jeremy Banks on SO (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/281389/2801707 for details).
* Explain icon adding/changing bit, include acknowledgement of sage on SO (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/24073988/2801707 for details).
* Expand to cover launching Emacs as emacsclient [-c] to connect to a server.
* Maybe replace the apps with a single script which generates them ... if I'm really bored.
